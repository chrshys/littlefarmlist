## ✨ MVP Features

### 🧾 Create Listing

  - **Title** (e.g., “Fresh eggs today”)
  - **Optional description**
  - **Items for sale** (simple list: name + price)
  - **Pickup instructions**
  - **Optional payment info** (e.g., "Cash or e-transfer to...")

- On submit:

---

### 🌍 Public View

  - Listing title
  - Items and prices
  - Description and pickup instructions
  - Payment options

- Clean, mobile-first design

---

### ✏️ Edit with Magic Link

- Edit mode accessed via `?edit=XYZ`

- Saves changes to `localStorage`

---

## 🧪 Testing the MVP

1. Open in mobile browser
2. Create a listing
3. Share the public link — verify it’s view-only
4. Open the magic link — verify edit access
